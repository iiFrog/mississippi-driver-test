I scoured the internet looking for websites to learn the Mississippi Driver's Test. But, they aren't free! Even the free ones have:

  1.) Have annoying ads built into the website
  2. A premium option they shove down your throat
  3. Are so white that the websites burn into your eyes
  4. are just annoying to use.

I looked everywhere for a free and open source way to learn, and found nothing. So here it is. I am making this for myself because I myself need to learn it, but others can of course benefit from it!
